This Python script demonstrates the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption technique that encodes messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a specified number of positions. It can be used for both encryption and decryption.

How it works:

Encryption: Shifts each letter in the input text forward by a given number of positions (known as the shift value).
Decryption: Shifts each letter backward by the same shift value to return the original message. The script handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, and non-alphabet characters like spaces and punctuation remain unchanged.
Usage:
Input your message: Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Enter the shift value: Specify the number of positions to shift the letters.
Select mode: Choose 'encrypt' to encode the message or 'decrypt' to decode it.
The resulting message is then displayed as the output.
